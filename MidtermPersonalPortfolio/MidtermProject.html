            <h2>Brief Summary of the 2025-2026 STEM Poster Symposium Research Project</h2>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>The focus of the 2025-2026 STEM Poster Symposium Research Project is a narrative multi-agent modeling-and-simulation-based decision support system, which allows a group of 5 agents to replicate themselve virtually using embodied agents,
                 and then they may use these embodied agents to simulate missions that they would otherwise undertake themselves without the personal costs to them in time, energy, and health. Using this narrative M&S DSS, they may optimize their plan,
                  assign tasks that are to be undertaken by each team-member, promote cooperation and coordination between one another, and also strategize approaches and agent subgroups based on their probability of success, which is determined by each agent profile.</p>
