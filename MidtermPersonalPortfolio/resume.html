        <h3>Skillsets</h3>
        <li><strong>KS Adoptive and Foster Child Assistance Fund</strong> Since Ryan aged out of the foster care system as a young adult, he has made substantial progress toward fulfilling his career aspirations as a researcher, thanks in part to this fund.</li>
            <li><strong>Hispanic Development Fund Scholarship</strong> Being of Germanic, Irish, and Mexican background, he was awarded a Named Scholarship by Dr. Jimenenez and her family.</li>
            <li><strong>NSF S-STEM Scholarship</strong> Having been highly interested in presenting at a STEM Poster Symposium, he was awarded an S-STEM Scholarship to continue his research and education at the graduate level.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Skillsets</h3>
        <ul>
            <strong></strong>
             <li><strong>Time-management</strong> Having nearly failed out during his first two years due to his ADHD, he finally got a grip on his time-management skills, and now he excels at estimating and forecasting how long things will take him to do.</li>
             <li><strong>Organization</strong> Again, after leaving the K-12 system to obtain a GED, since he was always a disorganized mess, he needed to develop strong organization skills, and this has been done with the help of process tutors</li>
             <li><strong>Curiosity</strong> He has been curious since he was a child! However, now that he is in college there is an endless supply of interesting topics to research, which is sometimes so overwhelming for him!</li>
              <li><strong>Hard-working</strong> As part of his cultural background and his frequent moves, he realized that he would have to develop a strong work-ethic to overcome his hardship and difficult socioeconomic circumstances. </li>
              <li><strong>Resilience</strong> Having been a three-year community college student with only one year under his belt, he recognizes the importance of persistence to achieving your aspirations; regardless of what comes your way, whether is be a fire, a social disaster, difficulties navigating college, you should not let anything stop you!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Jobs</h3>
        <ol>
             <li><strong>Red-Robin Gourmet Burgers</strong> Despite not relating to his aspiring research career, Ryan wants to emphasize his work experience because these jobs taught him his work ethic, and he never wants to go back!</li>
             <li><strong>Yaya's European Bistros</strong> At, Yaya's and Red Robin he served waiters and guests as a food runner, host, and server assistant; and on the back end, he did some dishwashing and bussing along with catering: he is multimodal! </li>
             <li><strong>CVS Pharmacy</strong> At CVS Pharmacy, he honed his underdeveloped accounting skills by working the front counter and register, and he also had learned the skill of stocking as well.</li>
              <li><strong>Savers</strong> At Savers, he worked the registers again and then also was responsible for hanging clothing and organizing the department store's shelves</li>
              <li><strong>Amazon</strong> At Amazon, he almost broke his entire skeleton with the amount of heavy-lifting and intensive hustling that he was required to do: and he worked from 1:00 am to 10:00 am at a warehouse in JOCO!</li>
        </ol>
